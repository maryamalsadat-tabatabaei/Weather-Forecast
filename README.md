# Weather Forecast

This is a weather forecast single-page application (SPA) developed using React, React Router, CSS, and the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to enter a city name and displays the current weather as well as a 4-day forecast. The weather is presented using appealing icons to enhance the user experience.<br>

**How it Works**

The weather forecast SPA integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the user's input city. React components are used to render the weather information and icons dynamically. The application utilizes React Router for navigation between the home page and the weather forecast page.
